# Dual Authentication: JWT and Session-Based Auth

## Why Use Both JWT and Session-Based Authentication?

### Complementary Strengths

**JWT Benefits:**
- Stateless authentication
- Cross-domain compatibility
- Mobile app friendly
- Microservices architecture support
- Contains user data within token

**Session-Based Benefits:**
- Server-side control over sessions
- Easy revocation of access
- Smaller client-side footprint
- Built-in CSRF protection
- Simpler token management

### Use Cases for Hybrid Approach

1. **Different Client Types**
    - Sessions for web browsers
    - JWT for mobile apps and APIs

2. **Security Flexibility**
    - Critical operations use sessions
    - Regular API calls use JWT

3. **Scalability Options**
    - JWT for stateless scaling
    - Sessions for user management

### Implementation Strategy

```javascript
// Route-based authentication choice
app.use('/web', sessionAuth);
app.use('/api', jwtAuth);
```

### Benefits of Dual System

- **Flexibility**: Choose appropriate method per use case
- **Security**: Multiple layers of protection
- **Compatibility**: Support various client types
- **Migration**: Gradual transition between systems
